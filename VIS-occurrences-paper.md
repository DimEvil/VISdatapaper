## Abstract

Since 1992 fish stoch assessments were done in Flanders(Belgium). Both inland waters and estuariene waters were monitored within the Flemish Fish Monitoring Network, mainly during the period from March to November (Verreycken, 2011). This network aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals. For several reasons,the complete dataset was published on http://data.inbo.be/ipt in two different subsets, VIS-Fish in estuariene habitats and VIS-Fish in inland waters. Both datasets were published by the Research Institute for nature and Forest (INBO), a scientific research institute of the Flemish government in Belgium. This datapaper, on the contrary, deals with both subsets together because of a similar structure, scope and methodology. The sum of the datasets creates a complete overview of fish pertaining in Flanders.

The VIS - Fishes in estuarine habitats in Flanders, Belgium subset is a species occurrence dataset. The dataset contains over 80.000 fish occurrences sampled between 1992 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the river Yser and the river Scheldt, in Flanders, Belgium. The dataset includes 115 fish species, as well as a number of non-target crustacean species. 
The VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium subset is a species occurrence dataset. The dataset contains over 350.000 fish occurrences sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders, Belgium. The dataset includes over 75 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). 

The data for both datasets are retrieved from the Fish Information System (VIS), a database set up to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders and are collected in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, certain red lists, and biodiversity research. Additional information, such as measurements, absence information and abiotic data are available upon request. Issues with the VIS-estuary occurrences dataset can be reported at https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/vis-estuary-occurrences and issues with the VIS-inland watters dataset can be reported at https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/vis-inland-occurrences

## Rationale

The Fish Information System or VIS (http://vis.milieuinfo.be) is a database set up by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders, Belgium. It contains data regarding occurrences, stocks, pollutants, indexes, and reintroductions. The consolidated database was set up in 2001, but sampling has been going on since 1992. The data are used to calculate the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio) in the framework of the EU water directive and Natura2000, as well as to provide updated information for the Flemish red list of brackish fishes. This dataset is a standardized extraction of all estuary and inland waters species occurrences in the VIS database. The VIS-database also contains fishes body mass and lengths. This data is only available upon request.

*the logo of VIS, the Fish Information System*

Two separate Darwin Core Archives were generated and published. The main reason herefore is that both datasets cover different habitats and are curated by scientists which have to report to different instances.  Nevertheless the datamodel used for Inland waters and Estuary occurrences is completely the same and the sum of both datasets equals a complete view of Fish occurences in Flanders until the end of the year 2012. Since 2013 a new set sampling locations was identified, therefore the data collected since 2013 is momentarily also only available upon request. 




## Taxonomic coverage

The estuary dataset contains 115 fish species found in the estuaries of the river Yser and the river Scheldt, as well as 8 non-target crustacean species. The class of Actinopterygii is best represented (109 species), along with some Petromyzontida (3 species), and Chondrichthyes (3 species). All the crustaceans in this dataset are from the order of the Decapoda.
This inland waters dataset contains more than 75 fish species found in Flemish streams and rivers, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans), some of which are invasive.

## Geographic coverage

###Flanders
Flanders is one of the 3 official regions of Belgium, a small federeal monarchy in the heart of Western Europe. The Flemsih region is situated in the north of the country and covers an area of 13.522 Km2 (44,29% of Belgium). The Belgian climate is maritime temperate, influenced by the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation in all seazons. The summer is moderate and the winters are mild. The two main geographical regions of Flanders are the river Yser basin in the North-West and the Central plain. Flanders is one of the most densely populated areas of Europe. The three major rivers in Flanders are the river Yser, the river Scheldt and the river Meuse. All rivers in Flanders flow into the North Sea but only the river Yser flows completely in the sea within the the jurisdiction of Flanders.

###Inland waters

The Inland waters dataset deals with enclosed waters and riverine habitats in Flanders, including head streams, affluents and canals part of the drainage basisns of the river Yser, the river Meuse and the river Scheldt. These 3 drainage basisns are divided into 11 Flemisch sub basins, which are divided into 102 sub-basins.

###Estuarien habitats


The Estuarine occurrence dataset deals with the estuaries of the river Scheldt and the river Yser.

#### River Scheldt

The river Scheldt originates on the plateau of Saint-Quentin near Gouy, a small town in the French department of Aisne. The river enters Belgium close to Tournai. Then the river turns East, in the direction of Antwerp. The Scheldt estuary begins near the city of Ghent. The last 160 km of the river, from Ghent to it's delta, the influence of the tides are still visible, creating a unique and valuable landscape for biodiversity. After crossing the city of Antwerp, hosting one of the worlds largests harbours, the Scheldt enters the Netherlands where it ends in the sea.
The Scheldt estuary is one of the last natural delta's in Western Europe and many areas near its riverbanks are marked as Natura 2000 area's. Especially its frechwater estuary area's are unique.

![Figure 8](images/image_8.PNG)

#### River Yser

The Yser originates in French FLanders, enters Belgium in the province of West Flanders and is the only is the only big river in Belgium that flows directly into the sea and is located near the town of Nieuwpoort. The river is 78 km long and Salt and fresh water meet in the estuary wich results in 130 hectares of special biotopes of mud flats, salt marshes, dunes, beaches and polders. The large numbers of coastal and wading birds, such as common shelducks, redshanks, Eurasian oyster catchers and curlews that find food and rest all year round on the mud flats, the salt marshes and the beaches of the Yser estuary.

## Methodology

### Study extent description

Four locations in the Yser estuary and 43 locations in the Scheldt estuary in Flanders, Belgium have been sampled since 1992. While the Yser estuary only covers a small geographical area, the Scheldt estuary is with 33.000 hectares one of the largest estuaries in Europe. It is also one of the few remaining European estuaries that include the entire gradient from fresh to saltwater tidal areas (`citation needed`). The 43 sampling locations in the Scheldt estuary are located in the river Scheldt, but also in the rivers "Durme", "Rupel", and "Zenne". In 2001, these locations were consolidated in a monitoring network for Flanders ("VISmeetnet") of 900 sampling points. The geographic coordinates in the dataset are those of the sampling locations. Since these do not always represent the actual coordinates of the catch, which may have occurred further up- or downriver, the coordinateUncertaintyInMeters has been set to 250.


Over 2000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders, Belgium have been sampled since 1992. In 2001, these locations were consolidated in a monitoring network ("VISmeetnet") of 900 sampling points. The geographic coordinates in the dataset are those of the sampling locations. Since these do not always represent the actual coordinates of the catch, which may have occurred further up- or downriver, the coordinateUncertaintyInMeters has been set to 250.

### Sampling description

Sampling methods are standardized and described in Van Thuyne, 2010 and indicated in the data as samplingProtocol. Per waterbody, the same method was used for each sampling campaign. The default method in estuarine habitats is paired fyke netting (99%), but additional techniques such as pound netting, electrofishing, and eel fykes netting also have been used. All fish were identified, counted, and measured for length and weight (measurement data available upon request).

Sampling methods are standardized and described in Van Thuyne, 2010 and indicated in the data as samplingProtocol. Per waterbody, the same method was used for each sampling campaign. The default method is electrofishing, but additional techniques such as gill nets, fykes, and seine netting (variable sizes) are used as well. Electrofishing was carried out using a 5kW generator with an adjustable output voltage of 300-500V and a pulse frequency of 480Hz. The number of electrofishing devices and hand-held anodes used depend on the river width. In riverine environments, electrofishing was carried out on both riverbanks in upstream direction. When gill nets were used, a set of four monofilament nylon nets was placed. All fish were identified, counted, and measured for length and weight (measurement data available upon request).

### Quality control description

Strict field protocols where used during the generation of this dataset. The Manual for Application of the European Fish Index (EFI) (Fame consortium, 2004) was used as a guideline for electrofishing and used in support of the EU water framework directive.
